# hockey

This is a personal data science project where I utilize machine learning to investigate an NHL dataset outlining details of roughly 25,000 hockey games played over approximately 20 years. I hope to use this analysis as practice for the following approaches: 

- identify appropriate variables to include as features
- handle duplicated and missing values 
- encode categorical variables with different approaches
- fit an XGBoost classification model to predict whether the visiting team will win
- assess the model accuracy and identify key features
